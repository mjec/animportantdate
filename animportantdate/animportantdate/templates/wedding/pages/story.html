  <h2>Curls</h2>
  <p>
    Since 2012, Michelle had been working as a Cantor (AKA Professional Jew who also sings) in Westfield NJ,
    while living in Jersey City. Her hobbies included long bike rides listening to sad early 00s alternative,
    telling it like it is, and genre television. She probably couldn't find Tasmania on a map.

  <h2>Beard</h2>
  <p>
    At the beginning of 2016, Michael was unhappily working as a lawyer in Tasmania,
    Australia. His solution was to quit his job and move 10,000 miles to New York to
    play with computers. As soon as he tried a real New York bagel he was hooked, and
    he now works as a software engineer for <a href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a>
    in Brooklyn.</p>

      Michelle and Michael met on <a href="https://www.okcupid.com">OKCupid</a> in
      late 2016. Our first date was lunch at a diner (Michael had french toast, Michelle had
      an omelette and rye toast), after which we saw Rogue One. We both left the date
      feeling pretty great; and three days later Michael left the country for a month.</p>
    <p>We stayed in touch while Michael was in Australia, and were both impatient
      to spend more time together. Together we visited diners, gardens, art
      galleries, museums, beaches and a pinball arcade, before moving in together
      in August of 2017.</p>
    <p>After managing to keep the ring hidden for nearly a month, Michael finally
      proposed on 29 March 2018. To everyone's great relief, Michelle said yes.</p>
